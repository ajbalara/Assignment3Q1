COMP 3005 - Assignment #3 Q1
Written by: Anand Balaram 101217776

This readme will explain how to use the program.

This folder contains the source code files for the application as an IntelliJ project.
The "DBCreation.txt" and "DBDataInsertion.txt" files are used to create and insert the initial data into the database. These must be run before running the application.
The name of the database is Assignment3Q1.

The application code can be run through running the Querier.java file in the src folder.

To demonstrate the functionality of the program, the code runs addStudent(), updateStudentEmail(), deleteStudent() functions with getAllStudents() before and after each call to display the state of the DB.

Below is a link to a video demonstrating the functionality of the code:
